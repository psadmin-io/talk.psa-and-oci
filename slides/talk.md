# Enhanced Security

???

* **Compartments and Tags**
    * https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm
    * https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm
* **Oracle Cloud Guard**
    * https://www.oracle.com/cloud/security/cloud-guard/
    * Gain a unified view of cloud security posture across Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customer tenants. Oracle Cloud Guard detects misconfigured resources and insecure activity across tenants and provides security administrators with the visibility to triage and resolve cloud security issues. Security inconsistencies can be automatically remediated with out-of-the-box security recipes to effectively scale the security operations center.
* **SL vs. SG**
    * https://k21academy.com/1z0-932/network-security-groups-vs-security-list-and-when-to-use-what/
    * A Security list lets you define a set of security rules that applies to all the VNICs in a subnet whereas Network Security Groups let you define a set of security rules that applies to a group of VNICs of your choice.
    * NSGs’ security rules apply only to the resources in that NSG. By contrast, Security Lists’ rules apply to all the resources in a subnet that uses the list.
* **Instance Principles**
    * https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm
    * Any user who has access to the instance automatically inherits the privileges granted to the instance.
    * Use dynamic groups to assign instances to group, then policy to the group for access
* **Demo**: Secrets from the Vault 
    * Show Vault from the Console
    * From Cloud Shell (psaoci)
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/cmtrial opc@
    sudo ioco vault read --secret-id=ocid1.vaultsecret.oc1.iad.amaaaaaaha7drbiaiihy3ewd3s76pv6w3r75ejy3ciaggvnjjzb3rrtlgwlq
    ```
